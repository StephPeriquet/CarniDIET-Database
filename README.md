# CarniDIET: A database of the diets of terrestrial, carnivorous mammals
The ecology of carnivores have been studied in ecosystems across the world. One facet of their ecology, their feeding ecology, is widely studied using standardised methods that describe the diet compositions of a population at a particular site over a given time period. In isolation, this information provides a valuable contribution to our ecological knowledge of a species at a particular location in their geographic range. In combination, these sources provide an opportunity to study species' dietary variation through space and time at macroecological scales.


# Aim
The aim of CarniDIET is to be the first open-access database available for accessing the quantitative data from data sources on the population-level diets of the world's terrestrial, carnivorous mammals to use in macroevolutionary, macroecological, and conservation research. As CarniDIET is just the tip of the diet data-iceburg, we aim to build upon this in the future to integrate data (1) from more sources, and (2) for more species, including ideally beyond mammals. We are eager to collaborate and to ensure these data are as useable for a wide audience, so we would welcome any feedback for future improvements.


# Version information
# 1.0
Version 1.0 consists of quantitative data on the diet compositions for 103 species of terrestrial, carnivorous mammals from (mostly) peer-reviewed scientific papers. Species selected were those that primarily consume mammals as a food type from MammalDIET (Kissling et al., 2014).

For a full description of CarniDIET 1.0, see: *Middleton, O.S, Svensson, H, Scharlemann, J.P.W, Faurby, S, Sandom, C.J. CarniDIET 1.0: A database of terrestrial carnivorous mammal diets. Global Ecology and Biogeography. In review.*


# Download instructions
While you can clone this repository, there are three options to download CarniDIET:

 - (1) Click the green "Code" icon at the top, and press "Download ZIP". You will download the entire repository, with CarniDIET 1.0 in the 'Version 1.0' folder.
 - (2) Go to the Shiny app (*URL TBC*) and download all, or a subset, of the data.
 - (3) See supplementary material of the original publication: (*URL TBC*).


# Future updates
As with any form of data collection, we are aware there will likely be errors within the database. To ensure we build an accurate and precise database that best reflects reported data from the primary sources, we encourage users to keep note of any transcription errors and contact Owen Middleton. As well as correcting these in future updates, we will also be including:

- Papers for 103 mammal-consumer species published since March 2019.
- Any missed diet records in sources in CarniDIET.
- Higher resolution records of non-mammalian diet records.
- Including further search criteria in WoS searches.
- Including further databases in searches (Zoological Records).
- Including other species not included in MammalDIET:
    - Dingos (Canis dingo)
    - Feral cats (Felis catus)
