# CarniDIET: A database of the diets of terrestrial, carnivorous mammals
The behaviour of carnivores within the world's ecosystems have been a hot topic of research for years. One such facet of their behaviour that has been heavily studied is that of their feeding behaviours, including the composition of a species' diet. In other words, the study of what individuals from the same species eat over a given unit of space and time.


# Our aim?
The curiosity of humans with the natural world has resulted in a surplus of valuable ecological data spread throughout the literature and various archives. While just the tip of the iceburg, we aim to compile these treasure trove of species diet data in a standardised way for use in future macroevolutionary, macroecological, and conservation research.

We want CarniDIET to act as a central database for storing quantitative data on the dietary composition of carnivores from a variety of sources (Version 1.0 currently consists primarily of peer-reviewed scientific papers). However, in the future we aim to build on this to incorporate (1) more species, including ideally beyond mammals, and (2) from more types of sources.

As with any form of data collection, we are aware there will be likely errors within  the database. To ensure we build an accurate and precise database that best reflects reported data from the primary sources, we encourage users to keep note of any transcription errors that occurred in the database and update us by contacting Owen Middleton. 

# Versions
# 1.0: CarniDIET (08/08/2020)
*Publication: TBC*

Version 1.0 consists of quantitative data on the dietary composition of 104 species of carnivorous mammals* from (mostly) peer-reviewed scientific papers.

Sources of carnivorous mammal diets can mostly be found on the public Mendeley group "CarniDIET 1.0": https://www.mendeley.com/community/carnidiet-1.0/. This public group will also be updated as the database is updated in the future.

*Primarily consume mammals as a food type [MammalDIET: Kissling et al. (2014)].

# Future updates
Including papers for 104 mammal-consumer species published since March 2019.

Including further species not included in MammalDIET:
  - Dingos (Canis dingo)
  - Feral cats (Felis catus)
  
Including further search criteria in WoS searches.
 
Including further databases in searches (Zoological Records).
